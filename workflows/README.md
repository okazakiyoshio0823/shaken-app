# Workflows

This directory contains the "processes" and "standard operating procedures" of the project.
These are repeatable recipes for accomplishing tasks.

## Examples

- `DEPLOY.md`: How to deploy the application.
- `TEST.md`: How to run and add tests.
- `NEW_FEATURE.md`: Checklist for adding a new feature.

## Usage

When the Autonomous Developer agent identifies a repeated pattern of work, it should be abstracted and saved here.
